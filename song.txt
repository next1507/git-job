I believe 
I can
I do 
I win



Low
 
Feel the weight of the world In my bones
Tried to swim but I’m sinking alone
falling in the deep unknown
Now I’m fighting with my
Hands up
Hands up
Feel the bullets from your
Head rush
Head rush

I can see you but
I can’t touch
can’t touch
Cause I feel numb
So infected with your
Bad blood
Bad blood
Keep on running till it
Blows up blows up
All I wanted was a real love
But I feel numb
